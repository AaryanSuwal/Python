1. Algorithm to add, multiply, subtract, and divide given number

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input 2 numbers num1, num2
Step 3: calculate
	sum = num1 + num2
	sub = num1 - num2
	mul = num1 * num2
	div = num1 / num2
Step 4: Display sum, sub, mul, and div
Step 5: Stop

2. Algorithm to find area of a rectangle and circle

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input length (l), breadth (b) of rectangle and radius (r) of circle
Step 3: calculate
	Area of Rectangle = l * b
	Area of Circle = (22/7) * r * r
Step 4: Display Area of Rectangle and Area of Circle
Step 5: Stop
 
3. Algorithm to find the price of n number of mangoes given the price of a dozen mangoes

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input price of a dozen mangoes (p) and no of mangoes (n)
Step 3: Calculate
	price of n mangoes = n * (p/12)
Step 4: Display n
Step 5: Stop

4. Algorithm to determine whether the given number is even or odd

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input a number num
Step 3: if (num % 2 == 0)
	   print (even)
	else
	   print (odd)
Step 4: Display num
Step 5: Stop

Logic Gates

AND (&&) gate: To make whole statement True whole statement needs to be True. For eg: x > 10 && y > 10 			    both x and  x and y need to be greater than 10 be make the statement true otherwise the whole 			    statement will be false.

OR ( || ) gate: To make the whole statement True either one statement needs to be True. For eg: x >10 || x > 10
		      either only x or y need to be greater than 10 to make the statement True.

#Algorithm to determine weather the given number is isosceles or not.


5. Algorithm to sum the given number digits

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input a number (num) and sum = 0
Step 3: Check until (num != 0)
	        rem = num%10
		sum = sum + rem
		num = num/10
Step 4: Print sum
Step 5: Stop

6. Algorithm to reverse the given number

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input a number (num) and rev = 0
Step 3: Check until (num != 0)
		rem = num%10
		rev = rev*10+rem
		num = num/10
Step 4: Print rev
Step 5: Stop

7. Algorithm to find if the given number is palindrome or not

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input a number (num), rev =0 and orgNum = num
Step 3: Check until (num != 0)
		rem = num%10
		rev = rev*10+rem
		num = num/10
Step 4: if (orgNum == rev)
		print ("palindrome number")
	    else
		print ("Not a palindrome number")
Step 5: Stop

8. Algorithm to find if the given number is prime or nor

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input a number (num)
Step 3: if num < 1
		print ("Not a prime number") and stop
Step 4: if n == 2 || n == 3
		print("Prime number")
Step 5: for i in Range(2, n-1)
	 	if(n%i == 0)
			print("Not a prime number")
		else
			print("Prime number")
Step 5: Stop

9. Algorithm to find the Fibonacci series

Step 1: Start
Step 2: input value of n
Step 3: if n<=0
		print ("Invalid") and stop
Step 4: if n == 1
		print 0 and stop
Step 5: Initialize 
		first term(a) = 0

		while (count < n)
		third term(c) = a+b
			print c
		update
			a = b
			b = c
		increment count
Step 6: Stop
